FoundersCard Safari Extension
=============================

[FoundersCard](https://founderscard.com/membership?code=FCBRAN430) is an awesome service, but I regularly forget what benefits I get from it. Several times I've bought something only to realize after the fact that I had a benefit I could have used, which is incredibly annoying. [FoundersCard](https://founderscard.com/membership?code=FCBRAN430) has a Google Chrome extension, but no Safari extension, so I made one.

## Installation

Just [download the extension](http://brandonweiss.me/founderscard) and open it or drag it into Safariâ€”it will automatically install.

## How does it work?

The extension adds a button to the Safari toolbar that will indicate if you have a benefit. If you go to a site without a benefit the button will be disabled. If you go to a site with a benefit, the button become clickable and show a little badge to get your attention. If you click it it will open up the benefits page so you can redeem your benefit.

## Tests

You'll need to have `node` and `npm` installed to run the tests.

Install the dependencies.

`npm install`

Then run the tests.

`npm test`
